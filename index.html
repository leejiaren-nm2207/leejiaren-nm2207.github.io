Asian-American talents definitely did not sprout overnight, so their sucess of today paints a story of a long-held prejudice stewing that's only just been uncovered.

      <p>However, simple trends can be deceiving. A closer look reveals that the increased representation belies little understanding of nuances in asian-american communities.
      <p class="leads"> 
        <br> Throughout the years, there have been a substantial increase in number of films with API as leads. Amongs 1300 top grossing movies, there was a good 7 films in 2019 that was helmed by API leads. At the same time, while their popularity have been on the rise, it may not be surprising to know that the pool of API actors remains sparse. Not only were there significantly rare as compared to white actors, they were also largely represented by a select few stars. For instance, 14 our of the 44 films with API Leads/Co-leads was led by Dwayne Johnson.

        <br>Furthermore, API communities are not equally represented...Being Asian American isnt a monolithic experience. Rather, Asia is a melting pot of diverse cultures and identiies, so grouping them together often makes for troubling depictions. Currently, a bulk of representation come from East Asia. For instance, talk about the ethnic heritage representation in film "Crazy Rich Asians".
        <br style="text-align:center";><canvas id="ethnicdiv" width="500" height="500"></canvas> -->
        <p> This is significant, because with the absymal lack of leading roles, there is significantly less opportunities to explore nuances in charatcer portrayal. This is perhaps most obvious in the variety of stereotypes that have been crippling Asian-American characters for decades.</p>
      <p class="stereotype">
        <br>Sometimes, mere representation can be even harmful, as they tend to reinforce stereotypes. Here's a snapshot of some of the most prevailing stereotypes of Asian-American on screen and their on-going prevalence. You may hover over the bars and find out what each of the stereotypes mean.

      <p>Through the most prevalent stereotypes of "Model Minority" seeming positive, these stereotypes are ultimately reductive and serve to obscure the real discrimination faced by Asian-Americans. </p>

      <h3>Act 3: Change is coming</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>However, is that to say flawed representation not representation at all? It is perhaps important to note that the increasing trend of Asian-American representation on-screen, no matter how inaccurate, have paved the way for so many other actors and characters today. 
      <br><br>Asian actors are increaisngly getting to play more fully-human characters, and these characters continue to build upon some of the prevalent streotypes, but giving nuances that are vital to appropriate character portrayal. Take the increasingly popular film "To All the Boys I've Loved Before", which showcases Asian lead Lara-Jean as a typical protagonist exploring sex, love and relationships in her youth. 
      <br><br>While this article mainly covers top-grossing films, future studies can explore representaton on television, and consider specifcially covering Asians, as the diversities between NHPI and Asian communities are so vast it should. </p>
